Certainly! A pure function is a fundamental concept in functional programming. Here are the defining characteristics of a pure function:

1. **Deterministic**: For a given set of inputs, a pure function always returns the same output. This means if you call a pure function with the same arguments multiple times, you'll always get the same result.

2. **No Side Effects**: A pure function does not have any side effects. It doesn't modify any external state or variables, and it doesn't perform observable actions like making a network request, writing to a file, or modifying global variables. All it does is take its input values, compute a result, and return it.

Given these characteristics, pure functions have several benefits:

- **Predictability**: Because they are deterministic and have no side effects, pure functions are predictable. This makes them easier to test, debug, and understand.

- **Reusability**: Pure functions are often general-purpose and can be reused in different contexts without fear of unintended consequences.

- **Concurrency**: Pure functions are inherently thread-safe. Since they don't modify any external state, multiple threads can execute them concurrently without any race conditions.

- **Refactorability**: Pure functions can be rearranged, combined, or separated without affecting the overall behavior of a program.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

**Pure Function**:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
Every time you call `add(2, 3)`, you will always get `5`, and there are no side effects.

**Impure Function**:
```python
total = 0

def add_to_total(a):
    global total
    total += a
    return total
```
In this case, the function `add_to_total` is not pure because it modifies the global variable `total`.

In summary, pure functions are a building block of functional programming that promote predictability, reusability, and maintainability in code.
